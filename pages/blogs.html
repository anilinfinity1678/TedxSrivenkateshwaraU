                            TED, as it reads Technology, Entertainment, and
                            Design - is a nonprofit organization performing live
                            talks dedicated to the spread of ideas empowered by
                            knowledge at its absolute core. It caters to varied
                            talking points in terms of the fields it deals with,
                            which can be extendable to any possible abstraction
                            from experiences worth sharing. However, at the same
                            time, each experience shared is highly specific to
                            the motive and concrete about the content of the
                            subject. Talks intended with purpose and information
                            are what inspired TED to bring it to the ground and
                            the people.

                            All of this may sound too heavy and intense for a
                            first-time listener but here comes the fun part -
                            it's NOT! One may end up binging TED talks when they
                            just want some food for thought for the field of
                            their choice. And the best part is, that, one can
                            always explore.
                            <br />
                            So, why is it fun? <br />
                            It’s fun because TED talks come with a character -
                            of its speaker and the speaker’s story, place, and
                            incidents involved. Hence, one ends up knowing a lot
                            more than they would expect. It’s a perception of
                            all aspects of an anecdote and one genuinely gets
                            driven by the direction of the story, and what was
                            intended as a big or small tangible change is
                            served.
